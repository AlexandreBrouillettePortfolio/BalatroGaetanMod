# BalatroGaetanMod
A mod made for a friend, introducing a Joker based on the Gaétan the Frog image which multiplies Mult by 1 + 0.1 per booster pack opened.

The sprites were made by me in Aseprite, and the code was based on the Steamodded files found in the Balatro Modding Framework here: https://github.com/Steamodded/smods

The included files are:
- assets/1x/gaetan.png: An image of size 71x95 of the Gaétan Joker.
- assets/2x/gaetan.png: An image of size 142x190 of the Gaétan Joker.
- gaetan.json: A text file indicating to the Steamodded executable the necessary variables to run the mod.
- gaetan.lua: A LUA file with the card implementation.
